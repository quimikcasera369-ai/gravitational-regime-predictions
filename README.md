# Gravitational Regime Transition Hypothesis – Pre-registered Predictions

## Purpose

This document records falsifiable predictions derived from a dynamical regime-transition model before observational comparison.

The objective is to prevent post-hoc fitting and define applicability conditions prior to evaluation.

---

## Core Hypothesis

Gravitational dynamics depend on crossing a critical collective regime, not solely on enclosed mass.

A system must reach a minimum internal gravitational coherence to exhibit the transition.

---

## Applicability Condition

The model applies only to systems capable of forming a collective dynamical regime.

Diffuse systems are predicted **not** to follow the transition rule.

---

## Prediction Rule

Transition radius:

R_T = sqrt(GM / a_crit)

Where:

* G = gravitational constant
* M = baryonic mass
* a_crit = critical acceleration scale

---

## Test Protocol

For each selected system:

1. Classify system as REGIME / NON-REGIME before calculation
2. Compute predicted transition radius
3. Record prediction BEFORE consulting rotation curve data
4. Compare with observed flattening radius

## Pre-registration Table

| System         | Regime Classification (prior) | Predicted R_T | Observed R | Agreement |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| (to be filled) |                               |               |            |           |

## Interpretation Rules

If classified REGIME:
Agreement supports the hypothesis.

If classified NON-REGIME:
Deviation supports the hypothesis.

If opposite occurs:
Hypothesis falsified.

## Commitment

All classifications and predictions are fixed prior to observational verification.
No retroactive adjustments permitted.
